# AES Encryption System
## Description
This was my first real project I designed and implemented all on my own. I wanted to do an encryption system due to my cyber security passion. This system allows for encryption and decryption of images as well as text files. It uses AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard) 128 bit as the form of encryption so it is reasonably strong but mainly this program is lightweight.
