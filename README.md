# AES Encryption System
### Description
This was my first real project I designed and implemented all on my own. I wanted to do an encryption system due to my cyber security passion. This system allows for encryption and decryption of images as well as text files. It uses AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard) 128 bit as the form of encryption so it is reasonably strong but mainly this program is lightweight. It also includes a C++ script to evaluate the decrypted file and orginial binary file to verifys they are the same. 

### How Does it Work?
- After the command is given the input file is passed into a function to determine if it is a image or text file. Once it is determined the file is then converted to its binary form.
- Next, the binary file is written to a new text file in the ouput folder. Once that is complete the python script calls the main.java file which performs the encryption and decryption of the original binary file.
- Finally, once that is finished the test.cpp file is executed which compares the decrypted file and original file to ensure they are identical.
- Note: This program will need to be run inside some sort of Linux state due to the makefile. I developed this in Ubuntu however i can recommend Cygwin terminal for windows users.
